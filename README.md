## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- PyTorch (compatible with your CUDA version, if using GPU)
- Learn2Learn
- PyTorch Lightning
- And other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation

To set up the environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lian-xiao/BioBridge.git 
   cd BioBridge
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirement.txt
   ```

## Running the Code

### Regular Learning Mode

To run the regular learning mode, execute the following command:

```bash
python Dti_cnn_main.py
```

This script will train the model using the regular learning approach as described in the paper.

### Running with CADA Module <a name="running-with-cada-module"></a>
To run the script using the CADA module for cross-domain drug-target interaction prediction, execute the following command:

```bash
python CADA/main.py
```

This script will utilize the CADA module to assist in predicting drug-target interactions across different domains, as detailed in the paper.

### Meta-Learning Mode

To run the meta-learning mode, execute the following command:

```bash
python Dti_cnn_meta.py
```

This script will train the model using the meta-learning strategy as described in the paper.

## Input Preparation

For the meta-learning part of the project, the data can be organized into a CSV file that includes the following columns: SMILES, Protein, Y, drug_cluster, target_cluster. The input structure is simple and straightforward.

## Output Explanation

In the context of conventional DTI (Drug-Target Interaction) tasks, the model will output the probability of drug-target interactions.

## Query Prediction

We have provided a `query.py` file that users can directly utilize for their own prediction tasks. This file uses the 5-shot weights from the BindingDB dataset and the weights trained on the PDB2020 dataset by default. It calculates the interaction strength as described in the paper.

To use this file, users need to prepare a CSV file for the support set, which should include drug-target interaction annotations that the user believes are related. Additionally, a CSV file for the query interactions should be prepared. The script will automatically construct the query task to generate the corresponding interaction strengths and output them to a new CSV file.

We have provided test data examples for reference.
